# Heart Disease Detection
## This project demonstrates the implementation of a heart disease detection system using Python. The project features a machine learning-based system where:

- Patient medical data is collected, cleaned, and prepared for modeling.
- Machine learning models are trained to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on the data.
- The predictions help identify high-risk individuals for early intervention and treatment.

This project provides a practical application of data science and machine learning techniques to solve real-world challenges in healthcare diagnostics.

## How to Set Up the Demand Forecasting System

1. Install Python and Required Libraries
   - Download and install python 3.9+ and libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn and seaborn.
2. Clone repository on local machine using git.
3. Create a project directory.
4. Prepare the dataset
   - collect the data from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset
   - Save the dataset as a CSV file.
5. Implement the heart disease detection script.
6. Run the script.
7. Analyze result

## Limitations
1. The dataset assumes completeness and correctness of patient records.
2. The accuracy of predictions depends heavily on the quality of the data and the selected features.
3. External factors, such as unrecorded medical history or lifestyle changes, may impact prediction accuracy.

## How It Works
1. Data Preprocessing: The medical data is cleaned, scaled, and transformed into features suitable for modeling.
2. Model Training: Machine learning models are trained to identify patterns in the data that correlate with heart disease.
3. Disease Prediction: The trained model predicts whether a patient has heart disease, enabling healthcare providers to prioritize care for high-risk patients.
